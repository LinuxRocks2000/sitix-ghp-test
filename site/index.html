# Sitix GH-Pages Test
This is a **test page** for Sitix deployed on Github Actions.  
It renders with the simple sitix site command, and moves the rendered outputs to a branch on this repository.  
Made with an adaptation of the steps at {Daniel Garcia's Medium post@https://medium.com/@danieljimgarcia/publishing-static-sites-to-github-pages-using-github-actions-8040f57dfeaf} on the subject, which was rather enlightening.

This is also a test-run of Sitix Markdown, because I *needed* one.
